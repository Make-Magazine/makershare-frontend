        <h2>TO MAKE SURE THIS IS A PLACE FOR EVERYONE</h2>
        <p>The following guidelines are intended to keep Maker Share a friendly, supportive and open community where makers
          of all kinds are welcome and encouraged to participate &mdash; regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion,

          <h4>DO Tell Your Story</h4>
          <p>Maker Share encourages you to share what you made, how you made it and why you made it. You are creating a valuable
            record of your own work and your own process of creating it. Your projects reflect your interests and your talents,
            providing evidence of a maker’s knowledge and expertise. Please also identify the resources you used such as
            tools and materials so that others are able to re-create your project.</p>

          <h4>DO Share Credit</h4>
          <p>Projects can be the result of the collaborating with other people. Be sure to provide credit to the people who
            helped on the project. Don’t claim ownership of work you did not create or use photos belonging to others without
            obtaining permission.</p>

          <p>When you share a project on Maker Share, you can decide how much you want to reveal about the project and the development
            process. The more you share the more others are likely to be interested in your project and provide you with
            meaningful feedback. We don’t own the content you post here. Any content, including images, sounds, and sample

            you undertake the project so you are NOT a danger to yourself or others.
