            In 2016, Make: and Intel came together with a shared vision: creating a global Maker
community for open innovation. Each felt the Maker community needed a place where
Makers could share their stories, their projects and their knowledge, a digital destination
where they could connect in the same way they do at Maker Faires around the world.
          </p>
          <p>To this end, Make: and Intel co-created Maker Share.</p>
        </div>

        <p>With the launch of Make: magazine in 2005, Dale Dougherty and his team provided the catalyst for a tech-influenced DIY community that has
come to be identified as the Maker Movement.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the Maker Movement is the realization that making is something that many of us enjoy. As people learn to become makers and
develop projects, they become innovators, as makers of change.</p>
        <p>Here on Maker Share, makers can document their participation in the growing Maker movement, including spotlighting their presence at
Maker Faires and engagement in Intel Maker Outreach activities, such as challenges and community missions.</p>
        <p>A central tool for achieving this are personal Maker Portfolios that provide a curated view of an individual Maker’s projects and abilities.</p>

        <div class="quote-area">
          <blockquote>The goal for me for Maker Share is to do some of the magic that we do
at Maker Faire online, where almost anybody has access to it.</blockquote>
          <span class="attribute">Dale Dougherty, Make: Founder and CEO</span>
        </div>

        <p>Maker Portfolios are especially relevant in an educational setting; many educational institutions are beginning to accept learning portfolios as
another measure, like grades and test results, of a student’s aptitude. As a record of a student’s hands-on learning – both the final product
and the creative process – Maker Portfolios belong in any setting where a student presents their accomplishment.</p>

      <p>Maker Share also provides a learning center that will help makers of different backgrounds develop new skills and learn to incorporate new
technologies into their builds. Drawing on the Make: catalog of books, thousands of published projects and produced videos as well as Intel
learning support, Maker Share will create learning paths that help beginners get started and advanced makers refine and validate their skills.</p>

        <div class="quote-area">
          <blockquote>The skills you learn through making is what is going to make you
successful in innovating in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</blockquote>

          <h3>What will you make?</h3>
          <p>Make: and Intel share a vision of a community of makers, fueled by a passion to create,
who will come together online to celebrate their successes…and their failures. Maker
Share will foster their collaboration and connect them to each other and to
opportunities; by so doing, we are creating a hub for open innovation.</p>
