This code is not intended for use in your project. This is just a very simple set of end-to-end
tests to verify that the server is producing the kind of documents that are expected. I just
wanted to include some basic e2e tests as part of demand-express so that I can verify that the
example server continues to work as part of the CircleCI process. I did this because there have
been several instances of the server breaking due to changes in the main library, and I want to
catch those kinds of problems as part of the CI builds. But do not copy this code to your project
as it is not intended for that.
